// Description
Nevermore was a construct designed to facilitate authentication between
various different applications - Firstly begun as a game authentication
server, but evolved into a suite that can be used between web pages, 
local applications, and embedded solutions.

The SDK provided is a high level implementation and requires only 1 
dependendency which is part of the Crexium software development Kit.

The current SDK is available to download and implement, FlexHandler
is the only attachment to this SDK, which can be replaced by another
transport layer protocol - FlexHandler is the transport layer used to
"hyper encrypt" traffic using block chain servicing, and hardware 
identification - For this reason, it is not included in the SDK.


// Key features
